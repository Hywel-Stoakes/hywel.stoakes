In addition, my domain name had expired and I had no idea how to migrate without some serious headaches. I revived the domain name, but realised the version of the site that was served was seriously out of date. It was an entirely static site and the pipeline I was using to update the content had stopped updating. In the interim I have moved institution and country and I came to the conclusion that I needed to either pull the site or update it with a more modern architecture.\nI needed a plan to either migrate to a new site and recreate the posts or patch together what I already had. Most of my previous site was used as a place to store some of my papers rather than used as a blogging platform. I have never been a very diligent blogger and have often left sites languishing preferring to create new sites rather than updating old content. See this old github site which is now broken completely apart from the twitter feed.\nI really didn’t want to move away from using Blogdown to update the site because I am so heavily invested in the R ecosystem and most of my analysis work uses it and Rmarkdown. I thought I would document a couple of the steps I took in the rebuild. In essence I just backed up and then deleted the site and re-downloaded the Hugo Academic template, adding in old posts and content very carefully.

Australian Indigenous languages have been claimed to operate somewhat differently in terms of prosodically conditioned consonant lengthening and strengthening. Consonants have been found to lengthen after a vowel bearing a phrasal pitch accent. It is further claimed that this post-tonic position is a position of prosodic strength in Australian languages. In this study, we investigate the effects of proximity to a phrasal pitch accent and prosodic constituent boundaries on the duration of stop and nasal consonants in words of varying lengths in Djambarrpuyŋu, an Australian Indigenous language spoken in northeast Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. Our results suggest that the post-tonic consonant position does not condition longer consonant duration compared with other word-medial consonants, with one exception: Intervocalic post-tonic consonants in disyllabic words are significantly longer than word-medial consonants elsewhere. Therefore, it appears that polysyllabic shortening has a strong effect on segment duration in these data. Word-initial position did not condition longer consonant duration than word-medial position. Further, initial consonants in higher-level prosodic domains had shorter consonant duration compared with domain-medial word-initial consonants. By contrast, domain- final lengthening was observed in our data, with word-final nasals preceding a pause found to be significantly longer than all other consonants. Taken together, these findings for Djambarrpuyŋu suggest that, unlike other Australian languages, post-tonic lengthening is not a cue to prosodic prominence, whereas prosodic domain-initial and -final duration patterns of consonants are like those that have been observed in other languages of the world.","tags":null,"title":"Prosodically conditioned consonant duration in Djambarrpuyŋu","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hywel M Stoakes","Janet M Fletcher","Andrew R Butcher"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550016000,"objectID":"34b8edb7c26ab5bee45d5817d2094e86","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/journal-article/2019-04-04-nasal-coarticulation/","publishdate":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2019-04-04-nasal-coarticulation/","section":"publication","summary":"Bininj Kunwok (BKw), a language spoken in Northern Australia, restricts the degree of anticipatory nasalization, as suggested by previous aerodynamic and acoustic analyses (Butcher 1999). The current study uses aerodynamic measurements of speech to investigate patterns of nasalization and nasal articulation in Bininj Kunwok to compare with Australian languages more generally. The role of nasal coarticulation in ensuring language compre-hensibility a key question in phonetics research today is explored. Nasal aerodynamics is measured in intervocalic, word-medial nasals in the speech of five female speakers of BKw and data are analyzed using Smoothing Spline Analysis of Variance (SSANOVA) and Functional Data Analysis averaging techniques. Results show that in a VNV sequence there is very little anticipatory vowel nasalization with no restriction on carryover nasalization for a following vowel. The maximum peak nasal flow is delayed until the oral release of a nasal for coronal articulations, indicating a delayed velum opening gesture. Patterns of anticipatory nasalization appears similar to nasal airflow in French non-nasalized vowels in oral vowel plus nasal environments (Delvaux et al. 2008). Findings show that Bininj Kunwok speakers use language specific strategies in order to limit anticipatory nasalization, enhancing place of articulation cues at a site of intonational prominence which is also the location of the majority of place of articulation contrasts within the language. Patterns of airflow suggest enhancement and coarticulatory resistance in prosodically prominent VN and VNC sequences which we interpret as evidence of speakers maintaining a phonological contrast to enhance place of articulation cues.","tags":null,"title":"Nasal Coarticulation in Bininj Kunwok: An Aerodynamic Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Djambarrpuyŋu has been described as having phonologically long and short vowels, and there have also been suggestions that consonants following short vowels undergo compensatory lengthening. The aims of this study are to investigate the phonetic nature of phonologically long and short vowels in Djambarrpuyŋu, and assess whether there is any evidence of consonantal lengthening. Results show that there are significant duration differences between the phonologically long and short vowels, and furthermore that consonants following short vowels have significantly greater duration than those after long vowels.","tags":["Phonetics"],"title":"Vowel Duration and Consonant Lengthening in Djambarrpuyngu","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hywel M Stoakes","Andrew R Butcher","Janet M Fletcher"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1418342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1418342400,"objectID":"7227c5e3aeae19af31861da91aa2be26","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/conference-paper/2014-12-12-pressure-impulse/","publishdate":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2014-12-12-pressure-impulse/","section":"publication","summary":"This study is an aerodynamic analysis of medial stop articulation in Bininj Gun-wok (also known as Bininj Kunwok). Like many northern Australian languages, BGW has two stop series found in word medial, intervocalic position, at all places of articulation with no con- trast for voicing or voice onset time. Acoustic and aerodynamic recordings of four speakers of the Kunwinjku dialect of Bininj Gun-wok were recorded under field conditions in a remote community of Arnhem Land. Three repetitions of real Kunwinjku words were recorded within a carrier phrase. The analysis includes the measurement of peak intra-oral pressure (Po) over time which is termed the Pressure Impulse (PI) after Malécot. Results show that peak pressure and consonant duration are independent pa- rameters and that while lenis and fortis stops differ in terms of duration and peak intra-oral pressure, they attain the maximum pressure peak at a similar time after closure. Pressure Impulse measurements also differentiate the stop types and furthermore, results show that there may be differences within the long stop category contrasting fortis stops with geminates (homorganic clusters).","tags":null,"title":"Revisiting the Pressure Impulse in Australian Languages: Bininj Gun-wok","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
