<p>I realised a few months back that my personal website had stopped updating and that I needed to put in some work to get it back up and running. In addition, my domain name had expired and I had no idea how to migrate without some serious headaches. I revived the domain name, but realised the version of the site that was served was seriously out of date. It was an entirely static site and the pipeline I was using to update the content had stopped updating. In the interim I have moved institution and country and I came to the conclusion that I needed to either pull the site or update it with a more modern architecture.</p>
<p>I needed a plan to either migrate to a new site and recreate the posts or patch together what I already had. Most of my previous site was used as a place to store some of my papers rather than used as a blogging platform. I have never been a very diligent blogger and have often left sites languishing preferring to create new sites rather than updating old content. <a href="https://hywel.github.io">See this old github site</a> which is now broken completely apart from the twitter feed.</p>
<p>I really didnâ€™t want to move away from using Blogdown to update the site because I am so heavily invested in the <strong>R</strong> ecosystem and most of my analysis work uses it and Rmarkdown. I thought I would document a couple of the steps I took in the rebuild. In essence I just backed up and then deleted the site and re-downloaded the Hugo Academic template, adding in old posts and content very carefully. Most of the installation information below come directly from <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">the blogdown book</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Install from CRAN
install.packages(&#39;blogdown&#39;) 
## Or, install from GitHub
if (!requireNamespace(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;)
devtools::install_github(&#39;rstudio/blogdown&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>I then updated Hugo from within Rstudio</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::update_hugo()</code></pre>
<p>This is the version of Hugo that I am running:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::hugo_version()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &#39;0.92.0&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Below is the theme that I ended up using, which is an update of the original theme. And this is the command I used to install it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::new_site(theme = &#39;wowchemy/starter-academic&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>There is a fair bit of customisation that needs to be done in the <code>config/_default</code> folder and the <code>content/home</code> folder. This is where you can choose to remove pages and content. The documentation is fairly easy to follow (<a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/">here</a>).</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> to serve the site as recommended by Yihui Xie and Blogdown. This seems to be fairly stable and I can get Netlify to build the site using Hugo in only a couple of seconds.</p>
